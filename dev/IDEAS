the game is a sort of rogue-like, but not exactly.

you have to deliver a package, but to do so you need to cross a dungeon.
if you die on that dungeon you comeback to the start without the package, you'll need to find it, it'll be nearby were you died, all the enemies respawn and there's a chance an enemy is with your package.

before every respawn there's gonna be a shop, i'll earn gold by finding chests and killing enemies.
